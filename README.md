To run this, please do the following:

1.download the Dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

The descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption

2.Download the R code.

3.Run the scripts.
